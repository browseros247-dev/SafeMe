/**
 * Universal block-gate host: a NopoX-style `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` window
 * that raises the block screen over the offending app WITHOUT launching an
 * activity. Used by every gate system — Prevent Uninstall, keyword/title,
 * website and schedule blocks — via [SafeMeAccessibilityService.launchGate] /
 * [launchScheduleGate].
 *
 * The block screen is the SAME self-contained [BlockOverlay] composable that
 * [BlockGateActivity] renders — it is reused and adapted here, not duplicated:
 * the overlay window hosts it in a [ComposeView] wrapped in a touch-consuming
 * [FrameLayout], so visuals, dwell countdown, "why" chip and Close behavior
 * are pixel-identical to the activity gate.
 *
 * Why an overlay:
 *  - First frame ~10–50 ms from the already-running service process, vs
 *    160–235 ms for an activity launch (no ActivityThread, no task, no theme
 *    inflation) — the gate covers while the offending page is still starting,
 *    so the page is never interactive.
 *  - No activity transition on the main looper, so no frame jank during the
 *    cover.
 *
 * Stability contract (highest priority):
 *  - The window type is `TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY` (2032) — the NopoX
 *    reference's exact type. This is deliberate: Settings-family windows set
 *    `HIDE_NON_SYSTEM_OVERLAY_WINDOWS` (observed live on both Vivo and stock
 *    Android 12+), which makes WMS force-hide every `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY`
 *    window while Settings is focused — the gate silently never presents and
 *    Uninstall stays tappable (the user's "sometimes good, sometimes bad"
 *    failure). Accessibility overlays are EXEMPT from that force-hide (they
 *    exist so TalkBack-style menus can draw over Settings).
 *  - CRITICAL: the WindowManager MUST come from the AccessibilityService's own
 *    `getSystemService(WINDOW_SERVICE)` — the framework overrides it to inject
 *    the service's window token (`wm.setDefaultToken(mWindowToken)`), which
 *    WMS requires for TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY windows ("unknown token null
 *    Aborting" otherwise). NopoX does exactly this. Never use the application
 *    context here.
 *  - If the overlay addView fails for any reason, [show] falls back to
 *    launching [BlockGateActivity] — the previous mechanism — so no gate type
 *    can ever break. The activity remains in the codebase as the permanent
 *    fallback.
 *  - A raw WindowManager window has no Activity to supply the
 *    ViewTreeLifecycleOwner + ViewTreeSavedStateRegistryOwner that Compose
 *    1.8 requires on attach (crash without them: "ViewTreeLifecycleOwner not
 *    found" / "Composed into the View which doesn't propagate
 *    ViewTreeSavedStateRegistryOwner" — both observed live on device). The
 *    overlay therefore wires its own [OverlayLifecycleOwner] onto the WRAPPER
 *    (the window's root view — the recomposer lookup runs there) and the
 *    ComposeView BEFORE addView, and moves it to RESUMED after attach
 *    (Compose's lifecycle-aware recomposer starts on ON_START). This is the
 *    standard chat-head/floating-window recipe.
 *  - The overlay is a singleton (NopoX `isPageShow` parity): concurrent
 *    detection paths dedupe on [isShowing], layered on top of the service's
 *    per-type cooldowns.
 *  - Dismissal mirrors [BlockGateActivity] exactly: launch HOME first (the
 *    "Close always goes to HOME" contract), keep the cover up through the
 *    transition so the page underneath never flashes, then remove the window
 *    and signal [SafeMeAccessibilityService.onGateDismissed] so the PU +
 *    keyword cooldowns re-arm and the post-dismissal re-probe chain starts
 *    (no accessibility-event-delivery dependency).
 *  - The overlay is `FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE`: BACK goes to the app below (matching
 *    the NopoX reference); dismissal is the dwell-gated Close button. The
 *    wrapper root is clickable so taps never fall through to the app
 *    underneath.
 *  - Some OEMs (Vivo) hide `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` windows when the display
 *    turns off and never re-show them after wake — the window stays attached
 *    and "visible" from the client's point of view (isShown()/window
 *    visibility report nothing wrong) while WMS keeps mLastHidden=true, so the
 *    gate is dead with the offending page exposed. The client cannot observe
 *    this, so a SCREEN_ON/USER_PRESENT receiver re-asserts the window on wake
 *    (a fresh window always presents; the ComposeView re-creates its
 *    composition on re-attach — the dwell countdown restarts, which is safe).
 *
 * Threading: [show]/[dismiss] are safe to call from any thread (detection runs
 * on `Dispatchers.Default`); all WindowManager/View/Lifecycle work is posted to
 * the main looper.
